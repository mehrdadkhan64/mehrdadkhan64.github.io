    <p style="color:#fe7f00; font-size:25; text-indent: 100px">Personally, I believe I am a very unique person. I feel socially awkward because I don't really follow social norms. For example: I don't use social media, I prefer to be isolated from others, and I don't know much about what is happening in the society. However, I have interests that might surprise all of you! One trait about me that really stands out is my interest of measurement. I enjoy guessing the height, mass, and temperature of things. My estimations are usually surprisingly accurate. For strange reasons, I always bring my measuring tape to school. Despite being shy of others, I am not shy at all when it come to measuring myself in front of other people. Every single day, I measure my height and weight. That's a really strange habit that I possess.</p>

    <p style="color:#fe7f00; font-size:25; text-indent: 100px">I have a lot dreams for my future. I am hoping to get into UBC, and I am applying for the Science programs. In order to get into UBC, I need to get good grades and participate in lots of extracurricular activities such as volunteering and joining clubs. Getting good grades is a piece of cake for me, but volunteering is a challenge for me. For whatever reason, I feel very insecure around other people which prevents me from wanting to volunteer. I have told myself many times to volunteer, but failed to do so. This year I have already applied for a volunteer program, therefore there is no going back. I have no choice but to endure it. I know volunteering is an easy chore most of us, but I am a much different person. Other than volunteering, the requirements for getting into UBC is rather lenient for me. As I have planning to take the one of the Science courses at UBC, there are several courses I should take at high school. For example Physics, Chemistry, Calculus, and Computer Science are suitable courses to take at Templeton if I want to apply for the Sciences. Deciding on my career for the future is a tough choice. My top careers choices are Engineering, Scientist, and Programmer.

    <p style="text-indent: 0px; color:#FF9E00; font-size: 35">Surprisingly, I don't watch any movie! The only movie I have watched is <u>Home Alone</u>, which I watched at school. That movie doesn't count as my favourite because it's uncertain which movie is better or worse than <u>Home Alone</u>. Therefore, I don't have a favourite movie.
